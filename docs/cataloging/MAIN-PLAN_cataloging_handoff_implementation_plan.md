## Phase 3: Workflow Optimization

### Sophisticated Model Switching Patterns

Based on the Cursor personas guide, the cataloging system should leverage these strategic model switching patterns:

#### **The Database-First Pattern**
```
Claude 4 Sonnet → Claude 4 Sonnet → o3 → Claude 4 Sonnet
(Build → DB Optimization → Security Analysis → Secure Implementation)
```
**Use for:** Database migrations, complex queries, schema changes

**Example Flow:**
```
Claude 4 Sonnet: "Generate cataloging_jobs indexes"
→ Claude 4 Sonnet: ";db" (systematic DB optimization)
→ o3: ";security" (deep threat analysis)
→ Claude 4 Sonnet: ";code" (production-grade implementation)
→ Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05: ";review" (comprehensive review)
```

#### **The UI Excellence Pattern**
```
Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 → Claude 4 Sonnet → Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05
(Creative UI Design → Reliable Implementation → Comprehensive Review)
```
**Use for:** Dashboard, review wizard, user-facing components

**Example Flow:**
```
Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05: ";ux" (design review wizard)
→ Claude 4 Sonnet: ";code" (implement wizard)
→ Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05: ";ux" (accessibility audit)
→ Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05: ";review" (final quality check)
```

#### **The Real-time Architecture Pattern**
```
o3 → o3 → Claude 4 Sonnet → o3
(Architecture Design → Security Analysis → Implementation → Performance Validation)
```
**Use for:** Real-time notifications, WebSocket connections, pub/sub systems

**Example Flow:**
```
o3: ";arch" (notification architecture)
→ o3: ";security" (channel security)
→ Claude 4 Sonnet: ";code" (implement subscriptions)
→ o3: ";perf" (scale analysis)
```

#### **The Performance-Critical Pattern**
```
o3 → Claude 4 Sonnet → o3 → Claude 4 Sonnet
(Performance Analysis → Initial Implementation → Deep Optimization → Final Implementation)
```
**Use for:** Dashboard with 1000+ items, bulk operations, search features

### Cost & Speed Optimization Strategy

#### **Cost-Effective Development Flow**

1. **Start with Claude 4 Sonnet** ($3/$15 per 1M tokens)
   - Initial code generation
   - Standard implementations
   - Database work
   - API development

2. **Switch to o3 only for complex reasoning** (higher cost)
   - Security audits
   - Architecture decisions
   - Performance analysis
   - Complex business logic

3. **Use Gemini 2.5 Pro for large contexts** ($1.25/$10 per 1M tokens)
   - Full codebase reviews
   - Large data analysis
   - Domain expertise (book cataloging)

4. **Reserve Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 for UI/UX**
   - Creative design work
   - Comprehensive code reviews
   - Accessibility audits

#### **Speed-Optimized Workflow**

**Rapid Iteration Mode:**
```
Claude 4 Sonnet (1.9s latency) → Quick fixes → Claude 4 Sonnet → Deploy
```

**Quality Assurance Mode:**
```
Implementation → o3 (thorough analysis) → Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 (review)
```

### Context Management for Model Switching

#### **Context Preservation Template**
```
Continuing cataloging system implementation. Previous context:
- Feature: [specific feature]
- Previous model provided: [key feedback points]
- Current focus: [specific task]
- Key constraints: [performance/security requirements]

@relevant_files
[Paste specific expert prompt]
```

#### **Model-Specific Prompt Optimization**

**For o3 (Deep Reasoning):**
```
";arch: Analyze the cataloging notification system systematically. Consider:
- Multiple failure scenarios
- Edge cases for 1000+ concurrent users
- Step-by-step reasoning for architectural decisions
- Trade-offs between different approaches"
```

**For Claude 4 Sonnet (Production Code):**
```
";code: Generate production-ready notification manager with:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear inline documentation
- Type safety throughout
- Following existing patterns in @src/hooks
- Include unit test structure"
```

**For Gemini 2.5 Pro (Large Context):**
```
"@entire_cataloging_module Review the complete cataloging system.
Consider relationships between all components:
- Database schema alignment
- API contract consistency
- UI/UX coherence
- Performance implications"
```

**For Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 (UI/Creative):**
```
";ux: Design the job review interface focusing on:
- Modern, intuitive design patterns
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessibility-first approach
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Creative solutions for complex data display"
```

### Workflow Execution Strategies

#### **Critical Path Optimization**

For the cataloging system's critical path (Tasks 1-6), use this optimized flow:

**Week 1: Foundation Sprint**
```
Day 1-2: Database & Types (Claude 4 Sonnet dominant)
- Morning: ";db" review → ";code" implementation
- Afternoon: ";perf" validation → ";review" check

Day 3-4: Hooks & Architecture (Mixed models)
- Morning: o3 ";arch" → Claude 4 Sonnet ";code"
- Afternoon: Testing with Claude 4 Sonnet

Day 5: Integration checkpoint
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: Full context review
```

**Week 2: UI Implementation Sprint**
```
Day 1-3: Dashboard (UI-focused models)
- Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05: ";ux" design
- Claude 4 Sonnet: ";code" implementation
- o3: ";perf" for large dataset handling

Day 4-5: Review Wizard
- Similar pattern with extra ";ux" accessibility audit
```

#### **Parallel Development Tracks**

**Track A: Backend (Claude 4 Sonnet dominant)**
- Database migrations
- API implementations
- Business logic

**Track B: Frontend (Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 dominant)**
- UI components
- User workflows
- Design system integration

**Track C: Infrastructure (Mixed models)**
- Real-time systems (o3 for architecture)
- Deployment setup (Claude 4 Sonnet)
- Monitoring (Claude 4 Sonnet)

### Quality Gates Between Models

1. **After Initial Implementation:**
   - Must pass ";review" before proceeding
   - Security-sensitive code requires ";security" check
   - Performance-critical code requires ";perf" analysis

2. **Before Production:**
   - Full system ";arch" review with o3
   - Comprehensive ";security" audit
   - Performance ";perf" validation
   - Final ";review" with fresh perspective

3. **Documentation Checkpoints:**
   - Each major component needs inline docs
   - API contracts must be documented
   - Architecture decisions recorded
