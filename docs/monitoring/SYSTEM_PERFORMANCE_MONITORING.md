# Booksphere System Performance Monitoring Guide

**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** Production-ready monitoring system deployed

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for monitoring the Booksphere system performance. The monitoring system tracks cataloging jobs, inventory search performance, and overall system health to ensure optimal performance and early problem detection.

## üéØ **What We Monitor**

### **Core Components**
- **Cataloging System**: Job processing performance and queue health
- **Inventory Search**: Query performance across 40K+ records
- **Database Indexes**: Usage patterns and efficiency metrics
- **System Health**: Overall component status and recommendations

### **Key Benefits**
- **Early Problem Detection**: Spot issues before they impact users
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify slow queries and unused indexes
- **Capacity Planning**: Track growth and resource usage
- **System Reliability**: Ensure all components are healthy

---

## üìä **Daily Monitoring Tasks**

### **1. Quick System Health Check**
**Frequency**: Daily (2 minutes)  
**Purpose**: Verify all system components are healthy

```sql
-- Run this first every day
SELECT * FROM run_system_health_check();
```

**Expected Results:**
- All components should show `HEALTHY` status
- Cataloging indexes: 7 configured
- Inventory indexes: 17+ configured
- Data volume should show growing numbers

**üö® Red Flags:**
- Any component showing `NEEDS_ATTENTION`
- Dramatic drops in data volume
- Missing indexes (less than expected counts)

### **2. Cataloging Performance Check**
**Frequency**: Daily (1 minute)  
**Purpose**: Monitor cataloging job processing

```sql
-- Check cataloging system performance
SELECT * FROM get_cataloging_performance_metrics();
```

**What to Look For:**
- **active_jobs**: Should be reasonable (not stuck high)
- **failed_jobs**: Should be low percentage of total
- **index_scans**: Should be growing (indicates usage)

**üö® Red Flags:**
- High number of failed jobs (>10% of total)
- Active jobs stuck at same number for days
- Zero index scans (indicates system not being used)

### **3. Inventory Search Performance**
**Frequency**: 2-3 times per week (3 minutes)  
**Purpose**: Ensure search queries are efficient

```sql
-- Check inventory search performance
SELECT * FROM inventory_search_performance 
WHERE usage_level != 'UNUSED'
ORDER BY scans DESC
LIMIT 15;
```

**Performance Indicators:**
- **HIGH usage**: Critical indexes getting heavy use ‚úÖ
- **MODERATE usage**: Normal operational indexes ‚úÖ
- **LOW usage**: Occasional-use indexes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **UNUSED**: May need removal or optimization ‚ùå

## üîç **Performance Interpretation Guide**

### **Understanding Metrics**

#### **Cataloging Metrics**
| Metric | Good | Concerning | Critical |
|--------|------|------------|----------|
| **Total Jobs** | Growing steadily | Flat for weeks | Decreasing |
| **Active Jobs** | 0-10 | 11-50 | 50+ |
| **Failed Jobs** | <5% of total | 5-15% | >15% |
| **Index Scans** | Growing | Stable | Decreasing |

#### **Inventory Performance**
| Usage Level | Interpretation | Action Needed |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **HIGH** | Critical path working well | Monitor regularly |
| **MODERATE** | Normal operations | Check monthly |
| **LOW** | Light usage | Review quarterly |
| **UNUSED** | Potential waste | Consider removal |

#### **Index Efficiency**
```sql
-- Deep dive into index efficiency
SELECT 
    table_name,
    index_name,
    scans,
    tuples_read,
    CASE 
        WHEN scans = 0 THEN 'UNUSED'
        WHEN tuples_read / NULLIF(scans, 0) > 1000 THEN 'INEFFICIENT'
        ELSE 'EFFICIENT'
    END as efficiency,
    usage_level
FROM inventory_search_performance
ORDER BY scans DESC;
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Problem: High Failed Jobs**
**Symptoms**: `failed_jobs` metric is high (>10% of total)

**Investigation Steps:**
```sql
-- Check recent failed jobs
SELECT 
    status,
    source_type,
    created_at,
    updated_at,
    extracted_data
FROM cataloging_jobs 
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Common Causes:**
- External AI service (Buildship) connectivity issues
- Invalid ISBN data
- Image processing failures
- Database connection timeouts

#### **Problem: Slow Inventory Searches**
**Symptoms**: Users report slow search performance

**Investigation Steps:**
```sql
-- Check for inefficient indexes
SELECT * FROM inventory_search_performance 
WHERE usage_level = 'HIGH' 
AND tuples_read / NULLIF(scans, 0) > 1000;
```

**Solutions:**
- Add missing indexes for common query patterns
- Optimize existing queries
- Consider archiving old data

#### **Problem: Active Jobs Stuck**
**Symptoms**: `active_jobs` count stays high for extended periods

**Investigation Steps:**
```sql
-- Check stuck jobs
SELECT 
    id,
    status,
    source_type,
    created_at,
    updated_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - updated_at))/3600 as hours_since_update
FROM cataloging_jobs 
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing')
ORDER BY updated_at ASC;
```

**Solutions:**
- Restart Edge Functions
- Check Buildship service status
- Manual job retry/cancellation

## üìà **Advanced Performance Analysis**

### **Weekly Deep Dive** (10 minutes)
**Purpose**: Identify trends and optimization opportunities

```sql
-- 1. Performance trends over time
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_jobs,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - created_at))/60) as avg_processing_minutes
FROM cataloging_jobs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date;

-- 2. Index usage patterns
SELECT 
    table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_indexes,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN usage_level = 'HIGH' THEN 1 END) as high_usage,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN usage_level = 'UNUSED' THEN 1 END) as unused
FROM inventory_search_performance
GROUP BY table_name;

-- 3. System growth metrics
SELECT 
    'Stock Items' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as current_count,
    MAX(created_at) as latest_addition
FROM stock_items
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Editions' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as current_count,
    MAX(created_at) as latest_addition
FROM editions
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Books' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as current_count,
    MAX(created_at) as latest_addition
FROM books;
```

### **Monthly Index Optimization** (15 minutes)
**Purpose**: Clean up unused indexes and add new ones

```sql
-- 1. Find completely unused indexes
SELECT 
    table_name,
    index_name,
    scans,
    'Consider removal' as recommendation
FROM inventory_search_performance 
WHERE scans = 0 
AND index_name NOT LIKE '%_pkey'  -- Keep primary keys
ORDER BY table_name, index_name;

-- 2. Find potentially over-indexed tables
SELECT 
    table_name,
    COUNT(*) as index_count,
    SUM(scans) as total_scans,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 8 THEN 'May be over-indexed'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as assessment
FROM inventory_search_performance
GROUP BY table_name
ORDER BY index_count DESC;
```

## üîî **Setting Up Alerts**

### **Manual Monitoring Schedule**
Since you're new to monitoring, start with this schedule:

**Daily (5 minutes)**:
- Run system health check
- Check cataloging metrics
- Review any alerts from previous day

**Weekly (15 minutes)**:
- Review inventory performance
- Check for inefficient indexes
- Analyze performance trends

**Monthly (30 minutes)**:
- Deep performance analysis
- Index optimization review
- Capacity planning assessment

### **Future: Automated Monitoring**
Consider setting up automated alerts for:
- Failed job percentage > 10%
- Active jobs stuck > 24 hours
- Index scans dropping significantly
- System health check failures

## üìö **Quick Reference**

### **Essential Monitoring Commands**
```sql
-- Daily essentials
SELECT * FROM run_system_health_check();
SELECT * FROM get_cataloging_performance_metrics();

-- Weekly review
SELECT * FROM inventory_search_performance 
WHERE usage_level != 'UNUSED' 
ORDER BY scans DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Monthly cleanup
SELECT * FROM inventory_search_performance 
WHERE scans = 0 AND index_name NOT LIKE '%_pkey';
```

### **Performance Baselines**
**Current System (as of Jan 15, 2025):**
- Stock Items: 41,176
- Editions: 39,443  
- Books: 38,709
- Cataloging Indexes: 7
- Inventory Indexes: 17

**Expected Growth:**
