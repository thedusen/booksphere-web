**Forbidden Actions:**
- **DO NOT** add columns like `is_signed` or `edition_number` to the `stock_items` table. Use the EAV pattern.
- **DO NOT** use `useEffect` for data fetching. Use TanStack Query hooks.
- **DO NOT** write database queries that are not scoped by `organization_id` where required.
- **DO NOT** modify the Supabase-generated `types.ts` file directly. All changes must come from a database migration.
