For any database work, always check Supabase schema first:
- List existing tables before creating new ones
- Check current schema before writing migrations
- Generate TypeScript types after schema changes
- Create development branches for testing
- Verify RLS policies for security
- Use execute_sql for queries, apply_migration for DDL
