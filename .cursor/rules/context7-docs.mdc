When working with specific libraries/frameworks, use Context7 to get current docs:
- Always resolve library ID first, then get docs
- Use for React, Next.js, Vue, Express, or any mentioned library
- Prevents outdated APIs and hallucinated methods
- Automatically engage when user says "use context7"
