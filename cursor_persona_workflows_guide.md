1. **Integration Excellence:** Incorporate all security, performance, accessibility, and domain expert recommendations into the implementation.
2. **Production Quality:** Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code that follows best practices and handles edge cases.
3. **Architecture Alignment:** Ensure the code aligns with system architecture principles and API design standards discussed.

Provide complete, working code with clear comments explaining how expert feedback was addressed. Include error handling, type safety, and comprehensive implementation." (Reliable implementation)
